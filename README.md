Clinic Abstract: 
"High-resolution topographic (HRT) data is becoming more easily accessible and prevalent, and is rapidly advancing our understanding of myriad surface and ecological processes. Landscape connectivity is the framework that describes the routing of fluids, sediments, and solutes across a landscape and is a primary control on geomorphology and ecology. Connectivity is not a static parameter, but rather a continuum that dynamically evolves on a range of temporal and spatial scales, and the observation of which is highly dependent on the available methodology. In this clinic we showcase the utility of HRT for the observation and characterization of landscapes and compare results with those of coarser spatial resolution data-sets. We highlight the potential for integrating HRT observations and parameters such as vegetation density, surface relief, and local slope variability with numerical surface process models. Participants will gain an understanding of the basics of HRT, data availability and basic analysis, and the use of HRT parameters in modeling."


This clinic is designed to provide an introduction and overview to high-resolution topography datasets, common methods of acquisition, basic terrain and channel analysis, and examples of integration of data with numerical modeling.

The structure is a combination of lecture and hands-on examples using jupyter notebooks within the google co-lab environment. The presentation, in pdf form, has section breaks when the clinic moves into co-lab.

The following links will open the notebooks in co-lab. Alternatively, you may download the notebooks for analysis within a local environment.
