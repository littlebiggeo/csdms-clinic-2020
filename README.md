# HRT Data-Model Integration Workshop
# Virtual "CSDMS 2020- Linking Ecosphere and Geosphere". May 20th, 2010
### John M. Swartz and Paola Passalacqua: The University of Texas at Austin
### jmarshallswartz@utexas.edu


This clinic is designed to provide an introduction and overview to high-resolution topography datasets, common methods of acquisition, basic terrain and channel analysis, and examples of integration of data with numerical modeling.

The structure is a combination of lecture and hands-on examples using jupyter notebooks within the google co-lab environment. The presentation, in pdf form, has section breaks when the clinic moves into co-lab.

The following links will open the notebooks in co-lab. Alternatively, you may download the notebooks for analysis within a local environment.

* [Part 1: Basic handling and analysis of high-resolution topography data](https://colab.research.google.com/github/littlebiggeo/csdms-clinic-2020/blob/master/csdms_2020_hrt_part1.ipynb)
  - This notebook covers basics of using and manipulating topography data with python workflows, and showcases the differences between data resolution in various metrics and analyses. It finished with an example channel network analysis workflow.
  
* [Part 2: Use of ANUGA in Flood Modeling](https://colab.research.google.com/github/littlebiggeo/csdms-clinic-2020/blob/master/csdms_2020_hrt_part2.ipynb)
  - This notebook provides an example of numerical modeling using ANUGA, an open source hydrodynamic model.
